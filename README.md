# InstaPicture
Crop Images to 16:9 and put them on a square white background. I use this program personally for my Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/Swapicteroo/

### Before:
<img src="doc/example-input.jpg" alt="before" width="50%" height="auto"/>

### After:
<img src="doc/example-output.png" alt="after" width="50%" height="auto"/>

## Installation
1. Download the `InstaPicture.jar` and the `start.bat` File in the [releases section](https://github.com/Swaggeroo/InstaPicture/releases/latest)
3. I recommend to put the files in a seperate folder
4. run the `start.bat`
5. After a short time you will see the processed pictures in the `output` folder

### Alternative way
1. Download the [InstaPicture.jar](https://github.com/Swaggeroo/InstaPicture/releases/latest) File
2. I recommend to put the file in a seperate folder
3. Create a `input` and an `output` folder
4. Put your pictures you want to convert in the `input` folder
5. run `java -jar InstaPicture.jar` in cmd
6. After a short time you will see the processed pictures in the `output` folder
